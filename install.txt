Note! You have to buld qt5 mysql driver for each os and pyqt5 version.
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/sql-driver.html#qmysql

After compilation done, copy driver to <path_to_pip3_packages_directory>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt/plugins/sqldrivers/
or on Windows C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\Qt\plugins\sqldrivers

On Windows when you distribute your application, remember to include libmysql.dll in your installation package. It must be placed in the same folder as the application executable. libmysql.dll additionally needs the MSVC runtime libraries which can be installed with vcredist.exelibmysql.dll (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

Use PyQt5==5.11.3 if "Driver is not loaded" but available on Windows after driver compilation.

Pre-builds for different os types is suited on libs/arch/sqldrivers/
libmysql.dll is placed in libs/arch/ folder

if "Driver is not loaded" error ocured try:
ldd <path_to_pip3_packages_directory>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt/plugins/sqldrivers/libsqlmysql.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmysqlclient.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmysqlclient.so.18
